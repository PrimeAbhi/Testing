                <h6>Screen Printing</h6>
                <p class="text-muted mb-0" class="innerDetail"> The idea behind screen prints is
                  basically a screened material such as silk or nylon is stretched across a frame and fastened into
                  place.
                  A stencil, cut my hand or made electronically, is placed over that screen to block out non printing
                  areas.</p>

                <h6>Digital Printing</h6>
                <p class="text-muted mb-0" class="innerDetail"> Laser and toner method uses a
                  laser
                  to charge the paper in certain areas which will attract toner of cymk colours to it. It then goes
                  through
                  a fuser which melts the toner into the paper. Magnetic works in much the same way but instead of
                  electrical
                  charges, it uses magnetic ones.</p>

              </li>

              <li class="innerDetail">
                <h6>Gravure</h6>
                <p class="text-muted mb-0" class="innerDetail"> This is a method usually used in
                  printing long runs of magazines. Much like flexography, gravure printing has a cylinder that picks up
                  ink in tiny etched grooves and places it on the paper. The difference is, gravure doesn't use a
                  plate.
                  Its grooves are actually etched into the cylinder. </p>

                <h6>Flocking</h6>
                <p class="text-muted mb-0" class="innerDetail">This can be added to a garment design using several methods. The first method is
                  as a transfer. This type of flocking is the flattest of the options because it is applied to the
                  garment via a heat seal press.
